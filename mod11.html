<center><h1>Module 11</h1></center>
<center><p>Though I have learned a lot this semester, most days were a challenge. Learning HTML and CSS is a skill set that I'm excited and proud to carry with me, but there were definitely times when I thought I was going to pull out my hair in frustration or lost my mind all together. I absolutely could not have made it through this class without my SCRUM partner, and I relied on her to help me not only master the basics, but to be honest with my about my final designs and website usability.</p></center>
<center><p>My SCRUM partner and I spent a large portion of this class in a state of confusion. We were both newbies to the world of HTML and CSS, and having each other to lean on was beneficial. We spent a lot of time outside of class texting each other questions about how to do certain things and technical issues we were having, trying our best to keep up and make sense of this language we knew almost nothing about. In class we looked at each other's code, especially when one of us had something that wasn't working, comparing and analyzing trying to find our mistakes. Having a fresh eye look at my stuff proved to be helpful as well, because sometimes she would catch the tiny detail that I had missed. We gave each other feedback on our design choices, and although our original designs looked fine as Photoshop images, we both realized that that didn't necessarily translate well to the actual execution of the site based on our skill level. So together we made changes that increased user friendliness while making it easier on ourselves to create. We also had help from a fellow classmate, who showed us why our links weren't working properly. Working in class provided me with a variety of people with more expertise and understanding than I had, which proved to be essential for my success.</p</center>
<center><p>When I encountered a problem that my partner and I couldn't figure out together, I googled "How-To" articles that were sometimes helpful and sometimes not. Sites like About.com and Codepen were two sites I used that provided explanations and examples to help me. For example, I seriously struggled with the creation of a decent navigation bar. At the time, I hadn't gotten to that part of my codeacademy, and was unsure how to write in this key part of my website. I ended up finding a navigation bar that I really liked from an example website (which I cannot find again to cite here for the life of me), which I ended up borrowing to include in my own design. I was really thankful for codeacademy as well, because a lot of my issues were solved by finding the appropriate chapter in codeacademy and practising there.</p></center> 
<center><p>Throughout the creation of my website, I set certain goals for myself. Mostly, I just wanted a functional site with links that worked and that wasn't a complete eye sore on the face of the internet. But I also wanted to learn to write my own CSS style sheet rather than using a template and altering it, and I was mostly successful in that. I needed help creating my nav bar and the padding for my border, but manipulating text, color, and placement is something I feel very comfortable doing now that my website is completed. I like my layout and design much better than the original plans I made, and I think that my site does a good job of showing my personality as well as being a professional place to display my portfolio.</p></center>
<center><p>Overall, I believe that this class was a valuable learning experience and, though I am still a novice, I am proud of the knowledge I have acquired and the new abilities I have gained concerning HTML and CSS.</p></center>
